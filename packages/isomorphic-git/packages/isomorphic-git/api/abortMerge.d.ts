/**
 * Abort a merge in progress.
 *
 * Based on the behavior of git reset --merge, i.e.  "Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are different between <commit> and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added). If a file that is different between <commit> and the index has unstaged changes, reset is aborted."
 *
 * Essentially, abortMerge will reset any files affected by merge conflicts to their last known good version at HEAD.
 * Any unstaged changes are saved and any staged changes are reset as well.
 *
 * NOTE: The behavior of this command differs slightly from canonical git in that an error will be thrown if a file exists in the index and nowhere else.
 * Canonical git will reset the file and continue aborting the merge in this case.
 *
 * **WARNING:** Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.
 * If there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes were further modified after the merge was started), `git.abortMerge` will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes.
 *
 * @param {object} args
 * @param {import('../typedefs.js').FsClient} args.fs - a file system implementation
